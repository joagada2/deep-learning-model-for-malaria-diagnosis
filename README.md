# DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR DETECTION OF MALARIA INFECTED RED BLOOD CELLS
In this computer vision project, I trained a convolutional neural network that takes an image of a red blood cell and predicts if the cell is malaria infected or not. The model has an accuracy of 94%. I deployed the model in FlasAPI and built a flask web application that uses the model to accurately diagnoses malaria infection.
